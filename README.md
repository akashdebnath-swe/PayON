### Stripe Implementation Guide

-   **First add this libraries**

```bash
npm install --save stripe @stripe/stripe-js
```

-   **Creating Payment Intent**

PaymentIntent is what tracks the customer's payment lifecycle, keeping track of any failed payment attempts and ensuring the customer is only charged once.

Endpoint: `/products/[id]/purchase`
<br>

`server side`

```tsx
import Stripe from "stripe";

const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY as string);

const product = // coming from database.

const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
    amount: product.priceInCents,
    currency: "USD",
    metadata: { productId: product.id },
});

if (paymentIntent.client_secret == null) {
    throw Error("Stripe failed to create payment intent");
}
```

> The `client_secret` is a unique identifier generated by Stripe for a specific Payment Intent. It is used to securely manage the payment process, ensuring that the client-side application can confirm the status of the payment. The `client_secret` helps track whether the payment has succeeded, failed, or is still pending, and is essential for securely handling payment interactions between your server and the Stripe API.

<br>

on your stripe dashboard you will get `stripe key & secret`
